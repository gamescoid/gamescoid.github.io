## Understanding Oklahoma’s Auto Insurance Requirements

Before you start comparing quotes, it’s important to be aware of the mandatory insurance requirements in Oklahoma:

- **Liability Coverage**: Oklahoma law requires minimum liability coverage:
  - **Bodily Injury Liability**: $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident
  - **Property Damage Liability**: $25,000 per accident
- **Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Coverage**: Coverage limits must match those of liability insurance.

Make sure any policy you consider meets or exceeds these minimum requirements to ensure compliance with state laws.

## Key Factors to Evaluate in Auto Insurance Policies

Once you have gathered your quotes, evaluate each policy based on the following factors:

- **Coverage Limits**: Ensure the policy provides sufficient coverage beyond the state minimum requirements.
- **Deductibles**: Compare deductibles to understand their impact on your premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.
- **Exclusions**: Be aware of what is not covered by each policy to avoid unexpected costs.
- **Discounts**: Look for discounts such as safe driver discounts, multi-policy discounts, and discounts for vehicle safety features.

## Comparing Costs and Benefits

While cost is a major consideration, it should be weighed against the benefits provided by each policy. Consider the following:

- **Premiums**: Compare the cost of premiums for each policy, but ensure that lower premiums do not result in inadequate coverage.
- **Claims Process**: Research each insurer’s reputation for handling claims efficiently and fairly.
- **Customer Service**: Good customer service can enhance your overall experience, especially if you need to make a claim or adjust your policy.

## Finalizing Your Auto Insurance Policy

After comparing quotes and evaluating policies, select the insurance provider that best suits your needs. Ensure that you:

**Final Checklist:**
- **Review Policy Documents**: Verify that all coverage details are accurate and meet your requirements.
- **Ask Questions**: Clarify any doubts with the insurer before finalizing your policy.
