The DLSS Swapper tool has received a significant update with the release of versions v1.1 and v1.1.1, introducing support for AMD's FSR 3.1, Intel's XeSS, and XeSS Frame Generation DLL files. This update expands the tool's functionality, allowing users to easily swap and update DLL files for various upscaling technologies.

### What’s New in DLSS Swapper v1.1?

The v1.1 release brings major enhancements to the DLSS Swapper tool, which was initially designed to allow users to manage NVIDIA DLSS DLL files. Now, the software has expanded its support to include other popular upscaling technologies, notably AMD's FSR 3.1 and Intel's XeSS. Users can now update and swap DLL files for these technologies, provided the game in question supports them.

If you're unfamiliar with DLSS Swapper, it's an open-source tool developed by 'beeradmoore' that enables users to manually update or downgrade the DLSS version in supported games. Unlike NVIDIA's official app, which automatically updates the game files, DLSS Swapper gives users more control over which version of DLSS is applied, including the ability to update FSR and XeSS files.

### Key Features of Version 1.1

Some of the standout features of DLSS Swapper v1.1 include:

- **Support for FSR 3.1 and XeSS**: You can now easily swap out DLL files for AMD’s FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) 3.1 and Intel’s XeSS technologies, assuming the game supports these methods.
- **XeSS Frame Generation**: Added support for swapping XeSS Frame Generation DLLs, enhancing the performance and quality of supported games.
- **Manual Game Addition**: Users can now manually add games that aren't listed in the standard installer paths, increasing the flexibility of the tool.
- **DLSS Frame Generation and Ray Reconstruction**: Swapping DLL files for these advanced features is now supported.
- **Additional UI Features**: New options, such as the ability to change game cover art, add notes, and several other minor improvements.

### Updates in Version 1.1.1

Following v1.1, the v1.1.1 update brings smaller but important fixes. It addresses several bugs, including issues related to launching games and the user interface. The developer is still working on resolving minor glitches, such as duplicate listings and a bug that prevents manually added games from displaying their DLL files.

### Why Is DLSS Swapper Important?

DLSS Swapper has become a go-to tool for gamers who want to take control of their upscaling settings. With the addition of support for technologies like FSR 3.1 and XeSS, the tool has expanded its value to a wider audience, offering flexibility for users to test and swap upscaling technologies from multiple providers.

For gamers looking to experiment with different upscaling technologies or troubleshoot compatibility issues, DLSS Swapper is an invaluable tool. The latest versions, v1.1 and v1.1.1, can be downloaded from GitHub, where you can find all the latest updates and features.
