Moon Studios CEO Thomas Mahler believes that PlayStation will eventually abandon its console exclusivity strategy, following in the footsteps of Xbox. According to Mahler, the changing dynamics of the gaming market and the gaming hardware landscape will ultimately lead to this shift.

### The Changing Landscape of Console Exclusivity

In a recent post on X, Mahler discussed the evolution of the gaming industry, praising Xbox's current approach to multi-platform gaming. He pointed out that several years ago, his studio, Moon Studios, chose not to develop *No Rest for the Wicked* under Microsoft's umbrella, as it would have prevented the game from being released on other platforms like PlayStation and Nintendo Switch. The studio felt that multiplayer and cross-play features were integral to the game's experience and would be hindered by the limitations of exclusivity.

Mahler used an interesting analogy to highlight the absurdity of console exclusivity, comparing it to the idea of DVDs being restricted to specific players. In his view, if it sounds unreasonable for DVDs to only work with certain players, then why is it acceptable for games to be locked to specific consoles, especially when PlayStation and Xbox consoles share similar hardware and controllers? Mahler argued that this inconsistency is increasingly difficult to justify as the gaming market stagnates in terms of console growth.

### Microsoft's Strategy and Its Impact on the Industry

Mahler praised Microsoft's current strategy of making games available across multiple platforms, including PlayStation and Nintendo Switch. He noted that Microsoft had begun moving away from exclusive releases last year, launching games such as *Hi-Fi Rush*, *Grounded*, and *Sea of Thieves* on PlayStation 5 and Switch. The move is part of a broader strategy to make gaming more accessible and reduce the barriers to entry, which Mahler believes is crucial for the industry’s growth.

Microsoft’s commitment to reducing exclusivity is seen as an effort to expand the gaming ecosystem and allow more players to access content, regardless of the console they own. According to Mahler, this shift is exactly what the industry needs, and he would be surprised if Sony didn’t eventually adopt a similar approach, ending the era of PlayStation-exclusive releases.

As of now, PlayStation continues to maintain a strong lineup of exclusive titles, but with Microsoft’s increasing focus on cross-platform releases, it will be interesting to see whether Sony will shift its stance. Games like *Microsoft Flight Simulator* and *Halo: The Master Chief Collection* have already been rumored to make their way to PlayStation 5, and the potential release of major titles on other platforms could signal a significant shift in the industry’s approach to exclusivity.

For now, PlayStation’s exclusives remain a major selling point for the brand, but as the gaming landscape continues to evolve, the lines between platform-specific releases may begin to blur. Whether Sony will follow Xbox’s lead and embrace a more inclusive approach to game distribution remains to be seen, but Mahler’s prediction certainly offers food for thought as the industry adapts to the changing demands of gamers.
